###Project Goals

The goal of this project is to create a more advanced version of the vim
editor. This editor will allow for more advanced ide-like features such as 
compiling within the program itself, provide a mini terminal emulator 
with which you can provide inputs and outputs for any programs being run.

We also wish to provide the ability to add in support for multiple languages
using simple plugins. The plugin system will allow any language to be used
(c, ruby, python, etc.) instead of using vimscript. 

*NOTE: This section is still a work in progress and more goals will be added 
      in the future.*

###Coding Style

We will be using the same general style used by the Linux Kernel found here: 
https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle
If you do not use this style, your code WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED!
So its not much but please learn and follow the coding style, I will provide
vimrc files that assist in this format on request.

###Languages

The languages used will be c and shell(bash) scripting. Tutorials can be found
online and if you require more help you can contact me through my email 
(found at the top of this Readme)
